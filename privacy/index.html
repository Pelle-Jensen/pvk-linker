                <p>We may share your information with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, payment processing, and customer support. We may also share your information if we are required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process, protect our rights or property, or prevent fraud or abuse of the App.</p>
                
                <h2>3. Your Choices</h2>

                <h2>4. Security</h2>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no security system is perfect and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at pelle@gentsgroup.no to have the information removed.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting a notice on the App or by sending you an email.</p>
